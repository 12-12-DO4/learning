React
  is a JS library relies on DOM (lib not framework)
  a lib for building composable UIs present data that changes over time by breaking them into comps
  when your comp is first init, render method is called
  generating a lightweight representation of your view
  (a string of markup is produced and injected into the doc)
  When your data changes, the render method is called again
  in order to perform updates as efficiently as possible
  we diff the return val from the prev call to render with the new and gen a min set of changes to DOM
  data returned from render is neither string nor DOM node
  it’s a lightweight des of what DOM should look like
AngularJS
  provides a declarative interface via directives and data binding
  requires a linking function to manually update DOM nodes

Gulp, Webpack
  bundlers that automatically combine deps into a single file

React Fiber Arch
  allows React to incrementally render the web page
  instead of immediately updating DOM with all virtual DOM changes, React can spread the update over time
  React can optimize when and where updates occur to DOM to significantly improve app performance and responsiveness to user input
  it's as a (priority sys):
    highest priority changes, the elems visible to the user (updated first)
    lower priority changes, the elems not currently displayed (updated later)
