HTML
  for web page structure
CSS
  for styling
HTML + CSS make static web pages and websites on sep pages
HTML & CSS (markup & styling langs not programming langs)

JS
  high level programming lang has to be converted to binary code so that a CPU can work with it
  used to to add mouseover effects and add interactivity to web pages or websites
  Java and JavaScript are in no way related
  but since the Java lang was so popular at the time, the name was changed from LiveScript to JavaScript
  is not a completely separate, stand-alone entity, exists as an implementation known as a JS engine
  Traditionally, the only environment in which it was possible to run a JavaScript engine, was the browser
  JS engine was just another building block of the browser
  was there to help a browser accomplish its users' goal of utilizing the internet for work, research, play ..
  JS engine itself comes with different ways to interact with various other parts of the browser (APIs)
  Thus, the code that you write in the JS allows you to:
    - Interact with the JS engine inside of the browser
    - Interact with other browser func exists outside of the JS engine, but is still inside the browser
  this all changed in 2009, when Node.js was built by a way to use a JS engine as a stand-alone entity
  Finally, it was possible to use JS outside of the browser, as a sep program on cmd or as a server-side env
ECMAScript
  In 1996 Netscape made a deal with the organization known as ECMA to draft the specification of the JS lang
  ECMA-262 is a standard that specifies how the JS lang should work
  There have been 12 ECMA-262 updates - the first one was in 1997
DOM
  represents all tags, elements, texts, ... as nodes or objects (parent, child)
  We access the DOM using JS to make dynamic websites
  There are many libraries and frameworks relies on DOM
React
  is a JS library relies on DOM (lib not framework)
  a lib for building composable UIs present data that changes over time by breaking them into comps
  when your comp is first init, render method is called
  generating a lightweight representation of your view
  (a string of markup is produced and injected into the doc)
  When your data changes, the render method is called again
  in order to perform updates as efficiently as possible
  we diff the return val from the prev call to render with the new and gen a min set of changes to DOM
  data returned from render is neither string nor DOM node
  it’s a lightweight des of what DOM should look like
AngularJS
  provides a declarative interface via directives and data binding
  requires a linking function to manually update DOM nodes

Bootstrap
  feature-packed, powerful and extensible front-end toolkit
  Some people refer to it as a
    - front-end framework
    - CSS framework or a CSS lib (trying to be more specific)
  popular lib of CSS & JS code you combine to quickly build visually appealing websites (responsive)
  (doc) https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/

npm (Node pkg manager)
  The most common pkg manager for front-end dev automatically downloads all of the dependency tree

Gulp, Webpack
  bundlers that automatically combine deps into a single file

React Fiber Arch
  allows React to incrementally render the web page
  instead of immediately updating DOM with all virtual DOM changes, React can spread the update over time
  React can optimize when and where updates occur to DOM to significantly improve app performance and responsiveness to user input
  it's as a (priority sys):
    highest priority changes, the elems visible to the user (updated first)
    lower priority changes, the elems not currently displayed (updated later)
