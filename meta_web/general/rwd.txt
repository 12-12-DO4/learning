means that a web page can automatically stretch or shrink depending on the screen is displayed on

responsive design is used to provide
  - the best user experience based on the device that the website is viewed on
  - Describe CSS media queries and screen resolutions
  - classified fluid images
  - differentiate between fixed and fluid grids

It is the combination of 3 techs
  - flexible grids:
    - allowing to adjust depending on screen size by defined in percentage values instead of defining website elem sizes based on pixels
    - are made up of
      - cols
      - gutters (space btw cols)
      - margins (left and right edges of screen)
  - fluid images
    - setting the CSS max-width prop of imgs to 100%
      - This enables an img to scale down to fit in a flexibly sized col rather than overflow it
      - but not grow larger and become pixelated if the col becomes wider than the img
  - media queries
    - part of media queries in css3 allow developers query about:
      - display size
      - orientation
      - aspect ratio
    - the pixel value specified is often ref to as the breakpoint
      - is the point at which a website's content and layout will adapt to provide the best possible UX
      - can function in different ways across three different grids
        - fixed grid
          - has fixed with cols and flexible margins
          - has a fixed content with that doesn't change in a specific breakpoint range
          - while the flexible margins occupy the remaining space on screen
        - fluid (full width) grids
          - fluid with columns and fixed gutters and side margins
          - has a flexible content with that goes edge to edge as per the screen 
          columns either grow or shrink to adapt to the available space
        - hybrid grids
          - have both fluid width and fixed with components

rwd frameworks provide multiple CSS rules based on diff device sizes to provide the best visual experience

Modern web dev is all about components
  - small pieces of reusable code that allow you to build websites quickly
  - 

Bootstrap
  - comes with
    - multiple comps for very fast construction of multiple comps, or parts of comps
    - pre-made set of CSS rules for building a responsive grid
  - you can just use the existing Bootstrap CSS classes to produce nicely-looking websites
  - its grid and pre-built comps is already written instead of high level of expertise in various CSS concepts
  - This is indispensable when you need to quickly iterate on website layouts
  - popular so understanding how to work with it is a prerequisite in many web development companies
  - u can be safe in knowing that both you and your team members have a common design system
    and you don't have to spend time deciding how to build one.
    You are free to jump from team to team, from project to project,
    even from one company to another and you don't need to re-learn their way of doing things
