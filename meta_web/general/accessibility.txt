It is good practice to think of accessibility from the beginning of a project
It is a lot harder to rework the project to be accessible later on

examples:
  - having text not contained within proper tags like p or h$
    makes it harder for assistive techs to interact with the content

  - using multiple line breaks to break up text and add space also presents barriers to accessibility
