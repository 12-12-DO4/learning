Notes
=====
if arguments of zip() function don't have the same length it will result in with the shorter length


class should be pre declared before instantiation
c=B() #this will give error
class B:
  b=5
b=B() #this will work and instantiate


Order of classes in multiple inheretance is important


remember that super built-in function shares variables and methods in paranet and sibling classes (classes with the same parent class)


statements inside a class body get executed irrespective of the instance creation. If a print statement inside the constructor, is not executed that's because it's inside a function.
