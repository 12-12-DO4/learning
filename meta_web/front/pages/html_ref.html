  It's good practice to add a short description for images.
  It helps improve accessibility and search engine rankings
  alt text isn't displayed anywhere on the site but will be read by assistive tech such as screen readers
  Screen readers and other accessibility tools use the alt attribute to provide information to their users

<!--
  basic structure for table
  tr stands for table row
  td stands for table data (cell or each col in the row)
  all elements must be inside a table elem
  note that it doen't look like a table but we will learn how to clear that with CSS
-->
<table>
  <caption>for table caption</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>table head 1</th>
      <th>table head 2</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>table data 11</td>
      <td>table data 12</td>

      <col>defines symantic group of columns in a table

  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td>table data 21</td>
      <td>table data 22</td>

<!--
  To make table more clear, add headers to the columns
  th stands for table head (cell at the first row for categories titles)

<!-- Forms -->
<form action="" method="">

  <input type="text">
  <br>
  <label>label for field2:</label><br>
  <input type="password">
  <br>
  <input type="submit">
</form>
<!--
  Actions specifies the URL or path that the form should submit the request to
  When the action attribute is not specified, it submits the request to the same path as the current web page
  with method attribute you can specify the HTTP method to use for the HTTP request when a user submits the form
  input elem is a field where user can enter data
  type attribute takes many values:
    - (text) makes the field allow diff chars and make it visible
    - (password) the same but hide the chars as a password typing
    - (submit) used as a button to submit the form
  label elem is added to make the form user friendly (easy to read and follow)
  all elems should be inside form elem
-->
<form action="">
  <input type="checkbox" name="op1" value="option1">
  <label for="op1">option1</label>
  <br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="op2" value="option2">
  <label for="op2">option2</label>
  <br><br>
  <input type="radio" name="ch1" value="choice1">
  <label for="ch1">choice1</label>
  <br>
  <input type="radio" name="ch2" value="choice2">
  <label for="ch2">choice2</label>
</form>
<!--
    - (checkbox) makes it possible to check multiple choices from a set of choices
    - (radio) like checkboxes however u can chek only one choice
  use the name and value attributes to configure how the data is sent to the server

<!--
    - (number)
    - (email)
    - (file)
    - (textarea)
      - as text but provid multi-line field
      - has controlled height and width through cols and rows attribute
    - (select)
      - a drop down list that allows multiple choices

  nothing in head elem is displayed on the web page
  meta elem is a self closing tag or empty elem with 2 main attrs:
    name
      specifies name of the metadata
    content
      specifies the value of the metadata
  
  metadata
    author
      the person and company who are the author of the web page
    description
      describes the content of the web page
      often used by search engines as descriptive text in search res
    keywords
      was previously used to provide search keywords for search engines
      however, this led lot of websites to use keywords metadata to manipulate search rankings
      One of the major search engines now ignores it and another uses keywords metadata as spam indicators
      it's recommended not to include this metadata in modern web pages
    robots
      tells search engines if and how they should analyze web page
      name comes from the automated SW often referred to as bots, that search engines used to analyze websites
      has four possible vals:
        index
          tells the bot to analyze the page
        follow
          tells the bot to also visit all links on the web page
        noindex
          tells the bot not to analyze the page
          Some bots will ignore this so it's best not to rely on this to stop bots from analyzing your page
        nofollow
          tells the bot not to visit links on the web page
          some bots will ignore this value so it's best not to rely on it
    viewport
      is imp in rwd for pages
      when a web pages viewed on a phone or tablet,
        device will by default attempt to render the web page as if it is being viewed on a desktop
        many search engines now include websites mobile x as a part of their ranking algo
      does not solve all the issues with browsing websites on mobile devices (other part of the soln is rwd)
      There are many vals available:
        set the width to device dash with and the initial scale to 1.0 (the most used)

  notes
  -----
    - Website consists of webpages and to link them we use anchor tags
    - Imgs are not inserted into web pages but img tag creates a placeholder for the img on the web page
    - There are two HTTP methods to submit the form data, GET and POST:
      - GET HTTP method retrieves information from the server
      - POST HTTP method sends data to the server
