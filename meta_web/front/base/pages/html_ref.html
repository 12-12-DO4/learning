  video and audio tags are used for embedding media on a webpage and both tags support diff file types 
  that can be played in the web browser
    For videos, the following file types are supported by most web browsers, MP4, WebM, and OGG
    For audio, the following file types are supported by most web browsers, MP3, WAV, and OGG
  
  "source" has no closing tag with 2 attrs
    - "src" add the address of the video file
    - "type" add the value "video/mp4"
  
  the video tag allows for multiple sources to be specified. 
    The web browser will check through the sources and use the first one that it supports. 
    If you prefer the web browser to use one format over another, then make sure to specify them in the preferred order
  
  attrs for video tag itself:
    - "width" and "height" of the player (to provide good ux)
    - "controls" enable player controls such as a pause and volume button
    - "loop" after reaching end, it automatically go back and play again from start
    - "muted" makes audio disabled by default
    - "autoplay" makes video automatically play

  audio tag works as the video tag
  MP3 file type is specified as "audio/mpeg" as MP3 is short for MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3

<iframe src="" sandbox allow="camera 'none'; microphone 'none';"></iframe>
<iframe src="" sandbox="allow-downloads"></iframe>
<!--
  iframe allows place or embed content from another website into a webpage
  its security has been a concern since its inception as it's vulnerable to malicious code and injection
    a webpage can run JS code. It's imp to ensure that you trust the website you're embedding into your own
  there are some attrs that can be applied to limit the behavior of the iframe
    "allow"
      limits which browser features the iframe can access
      There are many possible vals can be set:
        "camera 'none'; microphone 'none';" disables camera and microphone access in an iframe
    "sandbox"
      limits behavior within the iframe, such as preventing files from being downloaded and preventing pop-up windows
      similar to the "allow" attr, there are many vals can be set:
        "" when used with an empty value, all sandbox restrictions will apply to the iframe
        individual sandbox restrictions can be removed by adding attrs
        "allow-downloads" allow file downloads in the iframe
  While these restrictions help keep your users secure, there may still be security vulnerabilities in your web browser 
  that the embedded web page can exploit. Therefore, it's always best to be cautious when using iframes and 
  ensure that you trust the website that you are embedding. (Recommend that iframes are not used)

  There are many authoring tools available to produce animated and video game content for the web browser.
  But all of these are underpinned by one of four technologies:
    "GIF" and "webP"
      are used to animate images, but with no interactivity
      popular for embedding animated content and for building 2D video games and animations
    "2D Canvas"
      allows 2D graphics to be drawn in the web browser
      popular for building both 2D video games and animations
    "WebGL"
      popular tech for building 2D and 3D animations and advanced graphics
      a complex tech and req a lot of background info
      uses GPU to render graphics to screen (allows complex calcs: lighting simulation and rendering massive 3D worlds)
      it's not guaranteed that 2D canvas will use GPU. This will depend on the web browser implementation
    logic and behavior of an animation or video game is defined using JS
    add "id" attr to "canvas" elem to be selected in JS file

</form>
<!--
  Actions specifies the URL or path that the form should submit the request to
  When the action attribute is not specified, it submits the request to the same path as the current web page
  
  with method attribute you can specify the HTTP method to use for the HTTP request when a user submits form
  HTTP POST method is more secure than the HTTP GET method (default val)
    When form is submitted using the Post method, form data is inserted into the content of the HTTP req 
    instead of appended at the end of the URL as is done with the GET method
    the risk of using the HTTP GET method for form submission Check all that apply
      - data will be sent insecurely
      - data will be stored in the browser history
      - The web address may exceed the maximum length accepted by the web server.

  input elem is a field where user can enter data
  type attribute takes many values:
    - (text) makes the field allow diff chars and make it visible
    - (password) the same but hide the chars as a password typing
    - (submit) used as a button to submit the form
  label elem is added to make the form user friendly (easy to read and follow)
  all elems should be inside form elem

  metadata
    author
      the person and company who are the author of the web page
    description
      describes the content of the web page
      often used by search engines as descriptive text in search res
    keywords
      was previously used to provide search keywords for search engines
      however, this led lot of websites to use keywords metadata to manipulate search rankings
      One of the major search engines now ignores it and another uses keywords metadata as spam indicators
      it's recommended not to include this metadata in modern web pages
    robots
      tells search engines if and how they should analyze web page
      name comes from the automated SW often referred to as bots, that search engines used to analyze websites
      has four possible vals:
        index
          tells the bot to analyze the page
        follow
          tells the bot to also visit all links on the web page
        noindex
          tells the bot not to analyze the page
          Some bots will ignore this so it's best not to rely on this to stop bots from analyzing your page
        nofollow
          tells the bot not to visit links on the web page
          some bots will ignore this value so it's best not to rely on it
    viewport
      is imp in rwd for pages
      when a web pages viewed on a phone or tablet,

        many search engines now include websites mobile x as a part of their ranking algo
      does not solve all the issues with browsing websites on mobile devices (other part of the soln is rwd)
      There are many vals available:
        set the width to device dash with and the initial scale to 1.0 (the most used)

  OGP also uses meta tags added to the head elem, but they are slightly diff
    instead of 'name' attr, it uses the "property" attr to define metadata name
      each prop starts with "og:" (as a convention to identify it as an OGP related tag)
    it uses the content attribute to define metadata val
    req you must always include 4 props on a webpage
      Together, they enables social media platforms to create a preview of the shared web link
      title
        defines the title of the page, this is the text that will appear in the preview
      type
        defines the type of content, such as website, video, music, or article
        Depending on the val specified as type, other props may be req
      url
        defines permanent web address that social network must use for the specific page
      image
        defines URL to img must be display when the website is shared
    There are several other optional props
      description
        provides a des of the webpage
      locale
        des lang and territory of the webpage's content
        For ex, en_US specifies that the page is in E and the locale is US
      site_name
        describes the name of the overall website the webpage belongs to

<!--
  notes
  -----
    - Website consists of webpages and to link them we use anchor tags
    - Imgs are not inserted into web pages but img tag creates a placeholder for the img on the web page
    - There are two HTTP methods to submit the form data, GET and POST:
      - GET HTTP method retrieves information from the server
      - POST HTTP method sends data to the server
